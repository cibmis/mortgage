Offering  you the best options to achieve your financial goals is key for me.   Whether it's buying your first home, moving into your dream home, purchasing investment properties, consolidating debt or refinancing your current home, I will help you make the best choices for you.

      <p class="">Champaign - Urbana has been my home for almost 20 years, and love the opportunities available here for work and play. My husband, Tim, and I have been married for 25 years and have 2 sons, and a very spoiled Chocolate Lab.   We stay busy with the family and with our boys' activties.  When we take time off, we usually head to our cabin in Northern Minnesota to truly get away from it all.  I also enjoy the beach and sun, so try and travel with some of my best friends during the year too.  When I have some downtime, Tim and I enjoy some of the great local restuarants or trying our best to recreate some of the recipes at home.  </p>

      <p class="">I have been lucky enough to partner with some amazing people in the community to try and give back and support some great organizations.  Currently, I am on the Board for Courage Connection, as well as the Scholarship Committee at the YMCA.  We attend church in Champaign and are part of small groups there.  I have worked with many groups at Judah Christian School where our kids attended, as well as The American Heart Association Go Red Leadership Team.</p>
