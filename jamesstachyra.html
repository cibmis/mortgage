      <p class="">My name is James Stachyra and I am a Senior Mortgage Loan Advisor NMLS #895338 at CIBM Mortgage AKA Avenue Mortgage. I currently reside with my wife, 6 year old daughter and 1 year old son, in Northwest Indiana. I have been a member of the mortgage community since 2001. I am a goal and family oriented individual, striving to be the most helpful Loan Advisor that my clients have ever worked with. My approach for a smooth loan process begins with providing easy to follow instructions and keeping the customer informed every step of the way. The mortgage loan process can be a confusing and daunting task. My priority is to take all of the guesswork out for anyone looking to purchase or refinance a home. I invite you to read online reviews about the services that I have provided many satisfied clients. My success within the mortgage industry is due in large part to Realtor / Past and present Client referrals and positive online feedback and reviews. </p>

      <p class="">I volunteer with Young Hearts 4 Life. We go into the area high schools and do EKG testing on the students to identify conditions that can cause sudden cardiac death. This is our 13th year and we have screened over 220,000 students. It's so rewarding knowing I am making a difference in helping to save a child's life.  I also serve on the community advisory board for Young Hearts 4 Life.</p>
