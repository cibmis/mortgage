      <p class="">Don’t settle for any Mortgage Lender!
        Buying a home, especially your first home, is an awesome experience and possibly the largest investment you will make. But, it is very important that you work with a lender that has the knowledge and experience to guide you through the process. A lot has changed in the mortgage world over the last several years and if you work with a lender with little experience, it could be the difference between getting the keys to your new home or having your loan fall through. That’s where I come in!
        With over 10 years of lending experience, you can trust that I will help you navigate through the home buying process, every step of the way. Since everyone’s financial situation is different, I will be able to help customize the right loan product that best fits your needs. At CIBM Bank, we offer a full menu of mortgage products including Conventional, FHA, VA, USDA Rural Housing, and also down payment assistance programs. I’m committed to providing the best customer service possible to my clients, because I know I would expect no less if it were me buying a new home.
        Whether you are buying, refinancing or even building your dream home, my goal is to make your experience as smooth as possible. And getting preapproved is easy! You can apply from the comfort of your home with our secure online application, or applications can be taken by phone or we can schedule a time to meet in person. Let me be the one to help you along this journey, and make the dream of homeownership a reality!</p>
