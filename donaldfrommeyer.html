      <p class="">I have been in the mortgage business for over 40 years and I have seen everything including the ups and downs of the business.  The only thing that hasn't changed is the customer service that I offer to each person as they apply for their largest financial transaction of their life.  It is my job to take away their stress and to be there to answer their questions when they need them.  I follow the entire transaction from application to the closing and try to make it as simple and easy for them during the entire process.  I have been married to my wife for 43 years and we have 3 girls.  We also have 6 Grandchildren, 5 boys and 1 girl. I have been a High School and College Umpire and have been involved in the Little Leage program for over 45 years.  I have umpired the Junior League Regional and the Big League Regional and participated as an Umpire in the 2013 Big League Boys World Series in Easley, S. Carolina.  I was the first base Umpire in the USA Championship game.             </p>

      <p class="">As the District 7 Little League Umpire in Chief, I am involved in helping younger umpires work and aspire to reach their potential in umpireing.  Each year brings a few new ones that we teach from the basics, in hope that they to will become accomplished enough to qualify to umpire in Regional and World Series.</p>
