      <p class="">Kirstan has over 20 years of experience in the residential mortgage lending profession. Kirstan graduated from Taylor University with a degree in finance in 1998. After graduating (and spending the summer leading canoe trips down the Flambeau River in Wisconsin) she sensibly followed in her father's footsteps and became a mortgage loan originator.  Since that time, she has had the privilege of originating more than 1500 loans!   Kirstan loves working with first time homebuyers.  Her biggest reward is helping her borrowers find the best loan program for their needs and seeing their joy at the closing table. </p>
