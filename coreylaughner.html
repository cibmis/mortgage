      <p class="">I have been in the financial industry for over twelve years. During this time I have gained many skills and responsibilities from growing from my position as a bank teller to writing policies that impact the direction of the institution as my role of a compliance officer. I am very excited to return to the mortgage profession and helping get people into their dream homes. I was born and raised in Indiana and graduated from Seeger Memorial High School. After high school I obtained a degree from Danville Area Community College (DACC). I am heavily involved in community development and helping those who are less fortunate.</p>

      <p class=""> I am very family oriented. I met my wife, and best friend, in 2006 and have been together ever since. My step-daughter is a well-mannered straight “A” student who keeps us busy with all of her sports. Together we have Bella (our boxer), Wilbur(licious) (our mini goldendoodle),and three cats Cassius, Smokey and Cookie. I really enjoy spending time at home with the family (pets included), going to the gym, watching my daughter’s sporting events, golfing and playing drums. I am from Indiana so it should be expected that I am a HUGE Indianapolis Colts, Indiana Pacers, and Purdue Boilermaker fan! I also take any opportunity to improve on myself and am learning to live my best life, as cliché as it may sound.</p>
