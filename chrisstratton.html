      <p class="">I have a degree in Elementary Education from Indiana State University.  I worked in Indian Prairie CUSD 204 for a few years until I retired to stay home and raise my chldren.  Once my youngest went off to Kindergarten, I took a job as an assistant to a loan officer. After a few months, I went through training to become a loan officer and have been writing mortgages for the past 23 years!</p>

      <p class="">My husband and I have lived in Naperville for 38 years. Our three children are now grown and on their own.  They have blessed us with two (soon to be three) beautiful grandchildren.  I love being a grandma!  I belong to a masters swim team and enjoy getting up early and heading to practice. It's an awesome way to start my day.  In my spare time, when I'm not playing with the kids, I like to read, crochet, knit and quilt.</p>

      <p class="">I volunteer with Young Hearts 4 Life. We go into the area high schools and do EKG testing on the students to identify conditions that can cause sudden cardiac death. This is our 13th year and we have screened over 220,000 students. It's so rewarding knowing I am making a difference in helping to save a child's life.  I also serve on the community advisory board for Young Hearts 4 Life.</p>
