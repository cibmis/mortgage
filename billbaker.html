          <p><strong>Work Bio: </strong>In my small hometown, I grew up in the home mortgage business.  My grandfather was President of a Savings Bank and my father a founder and President of a successful Missouri-based savings & loan institution for over 20 years.  Upon graduation with a B.S. in Finance from the University of Missouri, I embarked on a 37 year professional career involving many aspects of Sales, Finance and Real Estate â€“ with 18 of these years exclusively in residential lending.  The home loan business is a perfect professional fit for me and I truly enjoy what I do.  I utilize my experience to assist families in finding a mortgage program that best fits their needs.  My approach is simple:  I educate my customers regarding the mortgage process so they can make informed decisions, providing both competitive terms and personal service.  I take pride that my business is built on relationships.  My philosophy of taking the time for thorough explanations and a "no surprises" approach to both the process and end results have led to a predominantly referral-based business for the past 14 years.</p>
          <p><strong>Professional Organizations: </strong>Russell Cemetery Association, Treasurer and Board of Directors, since 2005.  Fawn Lake Property Owners Association, President 2010 - 2018, Board of Directors 2010 - present.</p>
          <p><strong>About Me: </strong>I'm a Missouri native and my spouse, Alicia, was born and raised in New Orleans, Louisiana.  We relocated from Texas to Indiana in 1996 and we love Indianapolis.  Our "kids" are Lilly, a Russell terrier mix and Charlie, a standard poodle.  My main passion outside of work is motorsports of all types.  I participated as a driver/owner in sprint car racing across the Midwest and South over the course of 4 decades.  Additionally, I love music and live concerts and traveling to attend auto racing events while visiting friends and family.  We are huge Indianapolis Colts fans as well, having been season ticket holders for the past 7 years.</p>
          <p><strong>Community Involvement: </strong>Carmel Dad's Club, Events Volunteer, 2006 - 2016</p>
