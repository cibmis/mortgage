      <p class="">I have been a Mortgage Loan Originator since January of 2003 and have concentrated on the purchase side of the business partnering with many of the top Realtors in the area. I went to St. Viator High School in Arlington Heights and went to Northern Illinois University where I earned a Bachelor of Science Degree in Economics.  Although I can do refinance as well as purchase loans, I take special pride in being well versed on the VA loan and helping Veterans get into the best loan for them and their families.  Our Veterans sacrafices so much to ensure the safety of our country.  I in turn learned to be a great advocate for them by educating them on what is the best mortgage for them for both short and long term from a financial stand point.</p>

      <p class="">I grew up in Elk Grove Village and my mom still lives in that house. I have been married to my amazing wife Deb since June 30, 1984.  We have 2 boys who are now married and both are home owners and yes, I did their home loans! I became a grandpa on 10/15/2018 to a beautiful little girl and I love it! We have always had a family dog and currently have a Golden Doodle named Cubbie. My hobbies are playing softball, golf and occasionally bowling.  I am convinced that red wine will extend my life span so I am a member of Cooper's Hawk wine club..</p>

I am also a member of the GOA Association which has hundreds of companies looking to network and share business referrals.  I am a part of Military Mortgage Boot Camp which was started by a Marine Veteran in the Detroit area and we educate ourselves and in turn, educate Realtors on the VA home loan process.</p>
