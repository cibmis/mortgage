      <p class="">I have been in the real estate and mortgage lending industry since 1989 when I began processing loans and soon moved into the appraisal department.  In '92 I co-founded MLS Appraisal Services, Inc. with my husband Mark.  In '96 I started originating mortgage loans with one of the industryâ€™s biggest leaders in mortgage and have been doing it ever since. If you are a first time homebuyer, buying a vacation home or simply refinancing, knowing who to call is vital! I specialize in VA, FHA, FNMA, FHLMC (conventional), USDA, & various types of Specialty programs.  My knowledge in the mortgage business and one on one service has earned me the trust of referral after referral.  I have and still do serve on many community committees and have volunteered countless hours to various organizations. I have received several awards and recognitions for production and service. You can count on me to provide reliable pre-approvals and fast on time closings. Please call me for ALL your real estate needs! Cell: 630-258-2021 Mortgage Pam. Making life great one home at a time!</p>

      <p class="">My husband & I have been married over 30 years & have two wonderful daughters and one seriously hairy Golden Retriever named Charlie. My favorite vacation spot is Colorado, (which happens to be where our girls live now). Charlie also loves it there! Hiking, golfing and skiing are my hobbies when I carve out the time.</p>
