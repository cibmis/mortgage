      <p class="">I began my career in the mortgage lending industry in 1997.  I have been a loan officer with CIBM Mortgage (formerly Avenue Mortgage, Inc) since 2010.  I have worked with a variety of clients including first-time home buyers, those upsizing and those downsizing. I enjoy helping clients restructure their finances with a refinance.  More recently, I have focused on helping clients navigate home ownership and refinance as they go through or move on from a divorce. People needing my help in this area seemed to have found me as opposed to me looking for them.  I am humbled that my clients allow me to help them through such a personal and difficult time in their lives.</p>

    <div class="col-md-6 ml-5 mx-auto my-auto">
      <p class="">I grew up here in the western suburbs of Chicago. I have raised my 4 sons further west in the town of Sugar Grove for the past 17 years.  I have twin sons who are 19 and two more sons who are 17 and 15.  My boys and I love boating, water sports and family vacations.  Fun in the sun is what we enjoy.  The five of us love our 2 cats, Scotch & Winnie, at least when they will allow us to.  I graduated from Northern Illinois University with a Marketing degree.  Music has always been a part of my life whether it be in the NIU Huskie Marching Band, on my church's worship team or if you catch me singing in my car.  Now I get to enjoy my kids being involved in music.  I love watching them grow into the young men God created them to be.  I feel very blessed to be a Mom to my sons.   </p>
