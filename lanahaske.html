      <p class="">I have been a Mortgage Loan Officer since 2007. I enjoy what I do and have great satisfaction when I meet my client's mortgage financing goals. I have worked hard towards earning the reputation of being honest, knowledgeable, and also exceeding my client's expectations. When I receive a referral from one of my past clients, this is proof to me that I have achieved my goal ! This is truly the best "Thank You" that I can receive. This job has given me the opportunity to meet so many great people. Being able to help the first time homebuyer is the most exciting and rewarding ! Every Loan has a Story, Tell Me Yours !</p>

      <p class="">My interests include the outdoors, gardening, walking and enjoying time with friends. I love to do home improvement projects and trying new things and ideas. I grew up in Cicero and slowly moved west over the years. Currently my husband & I reside in the far west suburbs and enjoy the peace and tranquility of country living. We both have a huge love for animals, we have taken in over 15 animals in need when the opportunity arose. We always have a housefull ! I have put in many years volunteering at animal shelters.</p>
